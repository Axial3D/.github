# Axial3D

## Making patient specific care routine
Weâ€™re fundamentally transforming how surgery is delivered throughout the world by converting patient scans into highly accurate 3D images and 3D printed models. Physicians globally use our anatomical models for pre-operative planning, briefing surgical teams and the patient consent process.

# Open Source @ Axial3D

This repository is maintained by the Digital Services Team at [Axial3D](https://axial3d.com/) who are Software Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and Platform Engineers. We build software that automates the transformation of medical 2D imagery, such as CT and MRI, into patient specific 3D digital and physical models.

In this repository you will find contributions that we have made back to Open Source projects. We also publish Accelerator SDK libraries that our customers use to build integrations with the `Axial3D Insight API` at [bitbucket.org/axial3d](https://bitbucket.org/axial3d/).
